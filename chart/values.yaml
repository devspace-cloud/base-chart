# Components are independently scalable parts of your application
# Components can contain multiple containers which cannot be scaled independently from each other
components:
- name: default
  containers:
  - # Image tag will be automatically updated in runtime
    # when running devspace deploy or devspace dev
    image: yourusername/devspace
    resources:
      limits:
        cpu: "400m"
        memory: "500Mi"
        ephemeralStorage: "1Gi"
    # Environment variables
    env: []
    # Mount volumes in this container
    volumeMounts: []
  # Expose your component via service
  # URLs will be connected if name=external and externalPort=80
  service:
    name: external
    type: ClusterIP
    ports:
    - externalPort: 80
      # This is the container port that should be exposed through this service
      containerPort: 3000

# Define persistent volumes here
# Then mount them in containers above

# DevSpace CLI will append all pull secrets which are automatically created
